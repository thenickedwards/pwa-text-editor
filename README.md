Homework 19 PWA Homework: Text Editor

Additional backend code written for JATE - Just Another Text Editor written per acceptance criteria in [/assets/provided/W19-hw_README.md](/assets/provided/W19-hw_README.md).

## Work Done
* When a user opens the application in their editor, they should see a client server folder structure
* When a user runs `npm run start` from the root directory, then they find that the application should start up the backend and serve the client
* When a user runs the text editor application from their terminal, they find that JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
* When a user runs webpack plugins, they find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
* When a user uses next-gen JavaScript in the application, they find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
* When a user opens the text editor, they find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
* When a user enters content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, they find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
* When a user reopens the text editor after closing it, they find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
* When a user clicks on the Install button, they download my web application as an icon on my desktop
* When a user loads my web application, they should have a registered service worker using workbox
* When a user registers a service worker, they should have static assets pre-cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
* When deployed to Heroku, the application should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
